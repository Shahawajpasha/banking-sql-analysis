![Dashboard Preview](banner.jpg)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes synthetic banking transaction data using SQL to generate actionable business insights related to customer behavior, spending patterns, and transaction risk.

The goal is to simulate how data analysts work with transactional data in banks to support business decisions, risk detection, and performance tracking.

## 🧩 Dataset
The dataset consists of two tables:

- `customers55`: Customer profile data (city, segment)
- `transactions`: Transaction-level data (amount, category, date, risk flags)

Each record simulates a real-world banking transaction.
